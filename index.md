# ⚔️ Hybrid Ecosystem

Welcome to the official blog and documentation for the **Hybrid Ecosystem**.

## 🚀 Vision
A deterministic, AI-first orchestration layer for complex engineering and software project.

## 🛠 Core Components
- **[hybrid-GENESIS](https://github.com/barros73/hybrid-GENESIS)**: Logical Intent Mapping & Relationship Engine.
- **[hybrid-TREE](https://github.com/barros73/hybrid_TREE)**: Structural Requirement Decomposition & Feature Trees.
- **[hybrid-MATRIX](https://github.com/barros73/hybrid-MATRIX)**: Deterministic Code-to-Logic Traceability.
- **[hybrid-RCP](https://github.com/barros73/hybrid-RCP)**: Semantic Code Engine & AST Analysis.

## 🔬 Latest Updates
### [AI "Laser Sight" & Dry-Run Integration]
We just integrated predictive simulation and context-aware extraction directly into the CLI. Now AI agents can *see* the logic they are editing and *predict* if their changes will break architectural constraints.
